             elsewhere. Most of my formative years were spent in a state of escapism playing guitar. This later lead to a career in music - signed to Sub-Pop records as the touring/recording guitarst for Kyle Craft. With a hefty touring schedule,
             I've built quite an appetite for wanderlust. I'm pursuing programming at Epicodus to facilitate an off-season of creative remote work.</p>
