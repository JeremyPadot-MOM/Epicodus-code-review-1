             src="img/guitar.jpg">I spend a lot of my time absorbed in music and music related themes around the band. At times, I spend half the year on tour. It helps I love to travel. I like to take a personal trip once a year to rid myself of
             human interaction. These are usually my favorite times. In the off season I tend to be rather home-bodied. I spend most of that time with my cat and best friend Princess Haru. We do everything together.</p>

             sort through the ashes. Although I was behind the lens, I always feel as if it were experienced by someone else. I'm facinated by the juxtoposition of familiar and forign.</p>
